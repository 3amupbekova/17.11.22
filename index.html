<h1>Four seasons</h1>
<p>There are four different seasons in a year. The coldest season is always winter. The lakes and rivers freeze over, snow covers trees and ground like a white wooly counterpane. The days are getting significantly shorter and the nights are getting longer. The shining sun is cold and gives us no warmth.</p>
